1. According to the results, in the 'rate' column (4th column), the last one or two digits of those values in the pig-results.csv are slightly difference from corresponding values in the hive-results. 
  And I checked the results by using the scientific calcultor, and found out the results generated by hive is more accurate than the pig. 
  Besides, for the rows with same rate in two results, the sequence of these rows are not the same.
  
2. Find out what steps can be used in both of the old and new analyses, then store the result table after those steps were finished as a new data source, then do the following steps respectively. 
  For example, one analysis is asking for the first 10 rows of all data sorted by the first column, while the other one is asking for the first 20 rows of all data sorted by the first column. So we know both analyses need to aggregate the data and sort by the first column, then we do these two steps and save the result as a new table, and next we get the first 10 rows by using the new table for the first analysis and get the first 20 rows by using the new table as well for the second analysis. 
  The point is the same steps only need to be done once, it saves some time.
